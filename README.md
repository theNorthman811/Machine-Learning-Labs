# Book Rating Prediction Model

Welcome to the Book Rating Prediction Model project! This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the rating of books based on various features such as title, authors, language, number of pages, and more.

## Overview

The Book Rating Prediction Model project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the rating of books. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of information about books collected from Goodreads, including attributes such as book title, authors, average rating, number of pages, publication date, and more.

## Features

- Predicts the rating of books based on various features.
- Provides insights into the factors influencing book ratings.
- Allows users to make informed decisions when selecting books to read.

## Dataset
